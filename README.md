# Keylogger

This repository contains a simple keylogger implemented in Python. The keylogger captures keystrokes from the local system and sends them to a server for logging.

## Features

- Captures keystrokes from the keyboard using the `pynput` library.
- Sends captured keystrokes to a specified server using TCP/IP socket communication.
- Runs discreetly in the background.


### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

```bash
sudo apt install python3
